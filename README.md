This is a universal 3D model file for it in ".stl" format.

Directions to 3D print from your own printer:
1) Download a free 3D printing software, like "MatterControl 2.0" if you don't already have one that does "slicing" (compiling ".gcode" file from 3D model data like ".stl" files)

2) Open/import the .stl file into a blank workspace.

3) Go to "print"/"export" and specify print specs; I used:
    Material: PLA
    Extruder Temperature: 210 Degrees Celsius
    Bed Temperature: 60 Degrees Celsius
    Layer Height: 0.2mm
    Infill Density: 100%
    
5) "Slice" to compile into ".gcode" (detailed operating instructions for a specific printer make and model which you can pick from in the softwares that do "splicing" like MatterControl 2.0 etc.)

6) "Export" and designate where the new ".gcode" file will be saved on your computer

7) Transfer ".gcode" file to the microSD (or whatever/however your printer inputs data for prints)



I'm eventually gonna modify it so it interfaces with a socket wrench with the square peg socket.
